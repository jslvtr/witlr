# The objective
The objective of this hackathon was to create an application that would let users visualise some data collected by the government.

# The approach
We thought it would be best to create a colour-coded map of the UK, and then let the user view the different questions.
Depending on the country and the percentage selected for the current answer to the current question, the colour code would be different.

# Techincal details
We created the application in Processing (after trying with plain C# and failing miserably).
We have some data files (.csv) that hold percentages and some information about the questions and answers.

Feel free to contribute!
